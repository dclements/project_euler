Project Euler Libraries
=============

One of the ways that I've used to learn programming languages is to solve a set of
problems from Project Euler using that language.  I find that even if the language is
not well suited to PE-style problems, it is a good opportunity to try and think in the
language.  I don't work my way through the entire set of problems that I've solved so far,
but enough that I start to get a feel for the language and its idioms. 

After doing this a few times and just keeping my libraries locally, I decided I'd upload
them for Scala so that I could use them as an easy reference when asking questions. 

I am not going to upload the final problem solving solutions, but it should be noted
that there are still going to be spoilers for how I've solved some of the problems.

Scala
-----

There were several features of the JScience LargeInteger class that I wanted to take
advantage of, so the scala libraries include a wrapper to let me use them more easily
inside of Scala.
