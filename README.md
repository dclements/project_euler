Project Euler Libraries
=============

One of the ways that I've used to learn programming languages is to solve a set of
problems from Project Euler using that language.  I find that even if the language is
not well suited to PE-style problems, it is a good opportunity to try and think in the
language.  I don't work my way through the entire set of problems that I've solved so far,
but enough that I start to get a feel for the language and its idioms. Since this is
largely test code, I'll often play with patterns or ideas that don't necessarily make
sense just as a way of feeling out different approaches. 

After doing this a few times and just keeping my libraries locally, I decided I'd upload
them for Scala so that I could use them as an easy reference when asking questions.

I am not going to upload the final solutions, but it should be noted that there are still
going to be spoilers for how I've solved some of the problems.

Scala
-----

There were several features of the JScience LargeInteger class that I wanted to take
advantage of, so the scala libraries include a wrapper to let me use them more easily
inside of Scala.
